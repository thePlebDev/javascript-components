- this time I will be creating a tabbed window design

- so float: left makes elements get really close to eachother

- ok so lets do some reading on transitions in css. CSS transitions allow me to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. there is
a lot more you can do with it like that I will have to explore later


- so for the start we have the display set to none, that Is why nothing is showing when the page loads
- when the button is clicked we run the function with two varibles that are strings the first string is always 'event' the second on is
dependent on the location

- so when we click the london tab the onClick function is going to be run with the varibles of event and London
-we then loop through all the content and set the display to none. we get all the buttons and replace all the active classes with ''. but initialy
there will be no class with the handle of active


- so what happens when the page first loads every display is set to none, so nothing shows except for the buttons, when a button is clicked
the function openCity is called with the value of event and the value of event and the city if we click London then that value will be London
it will then loop through and set all displays to none, on the first call this will be useless. when something is set to display none, other
elements will act as if that element doesn't exist and adjust accordingly. we then loop through all the buttons and change all the active
classes to '', on the first call this will do nothing. The last thing that we do is set the current text to display block, we then also
add the active class

- so right now I should read up on some animation.


ANIMATION:
- css animations gradually lets an element change over time.
- when you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at
certain times and then to get that animation to work you msut bind it
so on the element in css you specify the animation duration and then you  define the animation in the @keyframes
